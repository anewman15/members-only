# Members-Only: Roast'Em

In this project, I created a members-only website where a user can taunt non-members. Non-members then are invited to sign up and roast their taunters back or insult other non-members of their interest.

The main focus of this project to exercise authentication using Devise, Active Record Migrations, Validations and Associations.

## Built With

* Ruby v 2.7.1
* Rails v 6.0.3.3
* Devise
* Bulma
* Simple Form
* SQLite3

1. Open your Terminal and navigate to the directory of your choice
2. Clone this repo from [here](https://github.com/anewman15/members-only/)
3. `cd` into the repo folder and run `bundle install`
4. Make sure you have the latest version of `yarn` installed in your machine. Sometimes the presence of `cmdtest` prevents `yarn` from being upgraded to its latest version
5. Run `rails db:migrate`
6. Run `rails server` and navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser
7. Sign up, log in and start creating some posts
8. The posts will show the full name of the user beside their gravatar image when you are signed in
9. Sign out of your account and the posts will no longer show the name of the poster and the gravatar
